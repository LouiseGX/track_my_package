# Project Proposal #

## Step Two of your first capstone is all about fleshing out your project idea. ##

For this step, please write a proposal based on the project idea you agreed on with your mentor. 

This proposal should be a 1-2 page document that answers the following questions: 

1. What goal will your website be designed to achieve?

2. What kind of users will visit your site? In other words, what is the demographic of your users?

3. What data do you plan on using? You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline
   what kind of data you would like it to contain.

4.  In brief, outline your approach to creating your project (knowing that you may not know everything in         advance and that these details might change later). Answer questions like the ones below, but feel free       to add more information:

      a. What does your database schema look like? 
      
      b.  What kinds of issues might you run into with your API?
      
      c.  Is there any sensitive information you need to secure?
      
      d. What functionality will your app include?
      
      e.  What will the user flow look like?
      
      f. What features make your site more than CRUD? Do you have any stretch goals?
